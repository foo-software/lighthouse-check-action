[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/getsentry/raven-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/getsentry/raven-node)

`raven-node` supports only LTS versions of Node, therefore currently required release is `>= v4.0.0`.
The last known working version for `v0.10` and `v0.12` is `raven-node@2.1.2`.
Please use this version if you need to support those releases of Node.
