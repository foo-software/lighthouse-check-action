/**
 * This module exists for optimizations in the build process through rollup and terser.  We define some global
 * constants, which can be overridden during build. By guarding certain pieces of code with functions that return these
 * constants, we can control whether or not they appear in the final bundle. (Any code guarded by a false condition will
 * never run, and will hence be dropped during treeshaking.) The two primary uses for this are stripping out calls to
 * `logger` and preventing node-related code from appearing in browser bundles.
