EXPIRED status indicates that the recovery point has exceeded its retention period, but Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see  Step 3: Delete the recovery points in the Clean up resources section of Getting started.  STOPPED status occurs on a continuous backup where a user has taken some action that causes the continuous backup to be disabled. This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning off versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by Backup. To resolve STOPPED status, ensure that all requested permissions are in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recovery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted. For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 STOPPED status occurs due to user action, application misconfiguration, or backup failure. To ensure that future continuous backups succeed, refer to the recovery point status and check SAP HANA for details.
