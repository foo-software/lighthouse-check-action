Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.

Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. You can use the endpointPublicAccess and endpointPrivateAccess parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control in the  Amazon EKS User Guide .

    /**
     * How to resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on. Conflicts are handled based on the value you choose:    None – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster, Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. Creation of the add-on might fail.    Overwrite – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster and the Amazon EKS default value is different than the existing value, Amazon EKS changes the value to the Amazon EKS default value.    Preserve – This is similar to the NONE option. If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster Amazon EKS doesn't change the add-on resource properties. Creation of the add-on might fail if conflicts are detected. This option works differently during the update operation. For more information, see UpdateAddon.   If you don't currently have the self-managed version of the add-on installed on your cluster, the Amazon EKS add-on is installed. Amazon EKS sets all values to default values, regardless of the option that you specify.
