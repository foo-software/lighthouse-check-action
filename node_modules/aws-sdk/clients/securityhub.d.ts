For example, the filter ResourceType EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup.   To search for values that start with the filter value, use PREFIX. For example, the filter ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that have a resource type that starts with AwsIam. Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy, AwsIamRole, or AwsIamUser would all match.    EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined by OR. A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. To search for values that do not contain the filter criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:   To search for values that do not exactly match the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS. For example, the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy matches findings that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy.   To search for values that do not start with the filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS. For example, the filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings that have a resource type that does not start with AwsIam. Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy, AwsIamRole, or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from the results.    NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND. A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the provided filter values would return valid results. You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.  For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2. It then excludes findings that have a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface.    ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam     ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2     ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy     ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
