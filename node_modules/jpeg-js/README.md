[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/eugeneware/jpeg-js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/eugeneware/jpeg-js)

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install jpeg-js
```

## Example Usage

### Decoding JPEGs

``` js
var jpegData = fs.readFileSync('grumpycat.jpg');
var rawImageData = jpeg.decode(jpegData);
```

### Encoding JPEGs

``` js
var width = 320, height = 180;
var frameData = new Buffer(width * height * 4);
var i = 0;
while (i < frameData.length) {
  frameData[i++] = 0xFF; // red
  frameData[i++] = 0x00; // green
  frameData[i++] = 0x00; // blue
  frameData[i++] = 0xFF; // alpha - ignored in JPEGs
}
var rawImageData = {
  data: frameData,
  width: width,
  height: height
};
var jpegImageData = jpeg.encode(rawImageData, 50);
```

## License

### Decoding

This library builds on the work of two other JPEG javascript libraries,
namely [jpgjs](https://github.com/notmasteryet/jpgjs) for the decoding
which is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License below:

### Encoding

The encoding is based off a port of the JPEG encoder in [as3corelib](https://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/source/browse/trunk/src/com/adobe/images/JPGEncoder.as).

The port to Javascript was done by by Andreas Ritter, www.bytestrom.eu, 11/2009.
