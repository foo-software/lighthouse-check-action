## 1.0.0 - 2019-01-23

### Notes
- **WARNING**: This release has a **BREAKING** change that could cause the
  canonical N-Quads output to differ from previous releases. Specifically, tabs
  in literals are no longer escaped. No backwards compatibility mode is
  provided at this time but if you believe it is needed, please file an issue.
- If you wish to use the native bindings, you must now install
  `rdf-canonize-native` yourself. It is no longer a dependency. See below.

### Fixed
- **BREAKING**: N-Quad canonical serialized output.
  - Only escape 4 chars.
  - Now compatible with https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/#canonical-ntriples

### Changed
- Improve N-Quads parsing.
  - Unescape literals.
  - Handle unicode escapes.
- N-Quad serialization optimization.
  - Varies based on input by roughly ~1-2x.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `rdf-canonize-native` as a dependency. The native
  bindings will still be used if `rdf-canonize-native` can be loaded. This
  means if you want the native bindings you *must* install them yourself. This
  change was done due to various problems caused by having any type of
  dependency involving the native code. With modern runtimes the JavaScript
  implementation is in many cases *faster*. The native bindings do have
  overhead but can be useful in cases where you need to offload canonizing into
  the background. It is recommended to perform benchmarks to determine which
  method works best in your case.
- Update webpack and babel.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `usePureJavaScript` option and make the JavaScript
  implementation the default. Add explicit `useNative` option to force the use
  of the native implementation from `rdf-canonize-native`. An error will be
  thrown if native bindings are not available.

## 0.3.0 - 2018-11-01

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Move native support to optional `rdf-canonize-native` package.
  If native support is **required** in your environment then *also* add a
  dependency on the `rdf-canonize-native` package directly. This package only
  has an *optional* dependency on the native package to allow systems without
  native binding build tools to use the JavaScript implementation alone.

### Added
- Istanbul coverage support.

## 0.2.5 - 2018-11-01

### Fixed

## 0.1.5 - 2017-09-18
