# Lighthouse Stack Packs

[Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) provides developers with guidance to improve their site by auditing for performance, accessibility and other best practices.

Many developers today use different technologies (backend/CMS/JavaScript frameworks) to build their web pages. Instead of only surfacing general recommendations, what if Lighthouse could also provide more relevant and actionable advice depending on the tools used?

**Stack Packs** allow Lighthouse to detect what platform your site is built on and display specific stack-based recommendations. These recommendations are defined and curated by experts from the community.
