## Using Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools

Lighthouse is integrated directly into the Chrome DevTools, under the "Lighthouse" panel.

**Installation**: install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser).

**Run it**: open Chrome DevTools, select the Lighthouse panel, and hit "Generate report".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/4dbab6bf5466e7220980bccd2f5883f4ad661725/assets/example_dev_tools.png" alt="Lighthouse integration in Chrome DevTools" width="500px">

## Using the Chrome extension

The Chrome extension was available prior to Lighthouse being available in Chrome Developer Tools, and offers similar functionality.

**Installation**: [install the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) from the Chrome Web Store.

**Run it**: follow the [extension quick-start guide](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#extension).

## Using the Node CLI

The Node CLI provides the most flexibility in how Lighthouse runs can be configured and reported. Users who want more advanced usage, or want to run Lighthouse in an automated fashion should use the Node CLI.

_Lighthouse requires Node 14 LTS (14.x) or later._

**Installation**:

```sh
npm install -g lighthouse
# or use yarn:
# yarn global add lighthouse
```

**Run it**: `lighthouse https://airhorner.com/`

By default, Lighthouse writes the report to an HTML file. You can control the output format by passing flags.

##### Output Examples

```sh
lighthouse
# saves `./<HOST>_<DATE>.report.html`

lighthouse --output json
# json output sent to stdout

lighthouse --output html --output-path ./report.html
# saves `./report.html`

# NOTE: specifying an output path with multiple formats ignores your specified extension for *ALL* formats
lighthouse --output json --output html --output-path ./myfile.json
# saves `./myfile.report.json` and `./myfile.report.html`

lighthouse --output json --output html
# saves `./<HOST>_<DATE>.report.json` and `./<HOST>_<DATE>.report.html`

lighthouse --output-path=~/mydir/foo.out --save-assets
# saves `~/mydir/foo.report.html`
# saves `~/mydir/foo-0.trace.json` and `~/mydir/foo-0.devtoolslog.json`

lighthouse --output-path=./report.json --output json
# saves `./report.json`
```

##### Lifecycle Examples
You can run a subset of Lighthouse's lifecycle if desired via the `--gather-mode` (`-G`) and  `--audit-mode` (`-A`) CLI flags.

```sh
lighthouse http://example.com -G
# launches browser, collects artifacts, saves them to disk (in `./latest-run/`) and quits

lighthouse http://example.com -A
# skips browser interaction, loads artifacts from disk (in `./latest-run/`), runs audits on them, generates report

lighthouse http://example.com -GA
# Normal gather + audit run, but also saves collected artifacts to disk for subsequent -A runs.


# You can optionally provide a custom folder destination to -G/-A/-GA. Without a value, the default will be `$PWD/latest-run`.
lighthouse -GA=./gmailartifacts https://gmail.com
```


#### Notes on Error Reporting

The first time you run the CLI you will be prompted with a message asking you if Lighthouse can anonymously report runtime exceptions. The Lighthouse team uses this information to detect new bugs and avoid regressions. Opting out will not affect your ability to use Lighthouse in any way. [Learn more](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/error-reporting.md).

## Using the Node module
You can also use Lighthouse programmatically with the Node module.

Read [Using Lighthouse programmatically](./docs/readme.md#using-programmatically) for help getting started.\
Read [Lighthouse Configuration](./docs/configuration.md) to learn more about the configuration options available.

## Viewing a report

Lighthouse can produce a report as JSON or HTML.

HTML report:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/443ff2c8a297dfd2297dfaca86c4966a87c8574a/assets/example_audit.png" alt="Lighthouse example audit" width="500px">

### Online Viewer

Running Lighthouse with the `--output=json` flag generates a JSON dump of the run.
You can view this report online by visiting <https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/>
and dragging the file onto the app. You can also use the "Export" button from the
top of any Lighthouse HTML report and open the report in the
[Lighthouse Viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/).

In the Viewer, reports can be shared by clicking the share icon in the top
right corner and signing in to GitHub.

> **Note**: shared reports are stashed as a secret Gist in GitHub, under your account.

## FAQ

### How does Lighthouse work?

See [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md).

### Why is the performance score so low? It looks fine to me.

Lighthouse reports the performance metrics as they would be experienced by a typical mobile user on a 4G connection and a mid-tier ~$200 phone. Even if it loads quickly on your device and network, users in other environments will experience the site very differently.

Read more in our [guide to throttling](./docs/throttling.md).

### Why does the performance score change so much?

Lighthouse performance scores will change due to inherent variability in web and network technologies, even if there hasn't been a code change. Test in consistent environments, run Lighthouse multiple times, and beware of variability before drawing conclusions about a performance-impacting change.

Read more in our [guide to reducing variability](./docs/variability.md).

### Can I configure the lighthouse run?

Yes! Details in [Lighthouse configuration](./docs/configuration.md).

### How does Lighthouse use network throttling, and how can I make it better?

Good question. Network and CPU throttling are applied by default in a Lighthouse run. The network
attempts to emulate slow 4G connectivity and the CPU is slowed down 4x from your machine's default speed. If you
prefer to run Lighthouse without throttling, you'll have to use the CLI and disable it with the
`--throttling.*` flags mentioned above.

Read more in our [guide to network throttling](./docs/throttling.md).

### Are results sent to a remote server?

Nope. Lighthouse runs locally, auditing a page using a local version of the Chrome browser installed on the
machine. Report results are never processed or beaconed to a remote server.

### How do I get localized Lighthouse results via the CLI?

Starting in Lighthouse 8.0, Lighthouse relies entirely on native `Intl` support and no longer uses an `Intl` polyfill. If you're using Node 14 or later, there should be no issue because Node is now [built with `full-icu` by default](https://nodejs.medium.com/node-js-12-to-lts-and-node-js-13-is-here-e28d6a4a2bd#9514).

However, if you're using a `small-icu` Node build, you may see Lighthouse log messages about your locale not being available. To remedy this, you can upgrade to Node 14+ or manually install ICU data by using the [`full-icu`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/full-icu) module and the [`--icu-data-dir` node flag](https://nodejs.org/api/intl.html#intl_providing_icu_data_at_runtime) at launch.

### How do I author custom audits to extend Lighthouse?

> **Tip**: see [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for more information
on terminology and architecture.

Lighthouse can be extended to run custom audits and gatherers that you author.
This is great if you're already tracking performance metrics in your site and
want to surface those metrics within a Lighthouse report.

If you're interested in running your own custom audits, check out our
[Custom Audit Example](./docs/recipes/custom-audit) over in recipes.

### How do I contribute?

We'd love help writing audits, fixing bugs, and making the tool more useful!
