- using a better library for polyfills as proposed by this PR ... https://github.com/remorses/esbuild-plugins/pull/19
- ...but there are a couple correctness changes on top of the above PR, as described here: https://github.com/remorses/esbuild-plugins/pull/19#discussion_r990493080 (the PR has landed but is still broken for our use case)
- File converted from TS to JS
